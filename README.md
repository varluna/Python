Network Course Scraper
This project contains a web scraping tool I developed 7 months ago while studying for a network course. The tool is designed to scrape questions and answers from the course's website. It was particularly useful for collecting and organizing the questions in the online book.

Features
Targeted Scraping: Efficiently extracts either questions or answers based on user input and functions.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to every other chapters.
Python-based: Leveraging powerful libraries for web scraping.
